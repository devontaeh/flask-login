# Backend Migration Plan: Flask to Node.js

## 1. Project Setup and Planning (1-2 days)
- **Setup Node.js environment:** Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
- **Initialize a new Node.js project:** Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
- **Install dependencies:** Install necessary NPM packages such as `express`, `mongoose`, `bcryptjs`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `express-session`, `passport`.

## 2. Database Connection and Configuration (1 day)
- **Set up MongoDB connection using Mongoose:** Configure `mongoose` to connect to MongoDB.
- **Test MongoDB connection:** Verify the connection works as expected.

## 3. Port Existing Flask Routes to Node.js (3-5 days)
- **Recreate Flask routes in Node.js:**
  - **Authentication and User Management:** Implement routes for login, logout, and user registration using `express` and `passport`.
  - **Session Management:** Configure session management in `express-session`.
  - **Form Handling and Validation:** Use `express-validator` for backend validations.
  - **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF protection using packages like `csurf`.

## 4. Implement Core Functionality (4-7 days)
- **Business Logic Migration:** Convert Python business logic into JavaScript.
- **Implement API Endpoints:** Ensure all RESTful routes are correctly implemented and tested.
- **Integrate Security Features:** Implement security features like CORS, CSRF, and use `helmet` for securing HTTP headers.

## 5. Testing and Debugging (3-5 days)
- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests using `jest` or `mocha`.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the entire application works as expected and integrates well.
- **Debugging:** Fix any issues that arise during testing.

## 6. Front-end Integration (2-4 days)
- **Connect with Front-end:** Ensure it integrates seamlessly with the backend.
- **API Consumption:** Make sure that front-end can consume the backend APIs correctly.

## 7. Deployment and Optimization (2-3 days)
- **Prepare for Deployment:** Configure the environment for production.
- **Deploy to Server:** Use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
- **Optimize Performance:** Fine-tune performance and fix any deployment issues.

## 8. Documentation and Final Review (1-2 days)
- **Document the API:** Use tools like Swagger to document the API endpoints.
- **Final Review:** Conduct a final review with stakeholders or team members.
